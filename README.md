# Milestone 3: Dynamic Resume Builder with Form

## Objective
The objective of this project is to convert a static resume template into a **Dynamic Resume Builder**. Users can fill out a form with their personal information, education, work experience, and skills, and the resume will be dynamically generated based on their input.

- **Real-time Resume Generation**: The resume updates in real-time as the user fills out the form, without requiring a page refresh.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures that all required fields are filled out correctly.
